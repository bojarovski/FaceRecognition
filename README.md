# Automated Attendance System Using Face Recognition

## Problem Definition

Manual attendance tracking (e.g., in lectures, meetings, or events) is inefficient, error-prone, and can be manipulated. This project aims to develop an automatic attendance system using computer vision and face recognition. The system identifies individuals through images and accurately records attendance.

Face recognition technology has advanced significantly, with various algorithms available. The key research influencing this project includes:

- **FERET Evaluation Methodology** _(Phillips et al.)_: A standard approach to evaluating face recognition algorithms, focusing on accuracy and reliability using a large database of facial images.
- **Comparison of Dlib and OpenCV** _(Boyko et al.)_: Analysis of popular face recognition software (Dlib and OpenCV), highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability in real-world scenarios.
- **CNNs for Face Recognition** _(Kamencay et al.)_: Demonstrated how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) improve accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods in recognizing faces.

These studies provide a solid foundation for choosing effective techniques and evaluating our face recognition system.
