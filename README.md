# Automated Attendance System Using Face Recognition

## Problem Definition

Manual attendance tracking (e.g., in lectures, meetings, or events) is inefficient, error-prone, and susceptible to manipulation. This project aims to develop an automated attendance system using **computer vision** and **face recognition**. The system will detect and recognize individuals from images, ensuring an accurate and seamless attendance recording process.
